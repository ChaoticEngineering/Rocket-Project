Design considerations:

The Design is going to be a tri-engine desing... (I'm sure there is a technical name for this) using the D12-5 Rocket motor, since this motor alone can take a resonable 200g
payload not counting for the motor itself. However this does include, the rocket body, electronics...ect.

While, a two motor desing would be possible, I would imagine the design would be more difficult to get even propolsion on both sides causing our rocket to either
launch into the pad or veir way off course.

The average thrust produced by each motor is 12N, so 3 motors should give us an apporixmate thrust of 36N. Not taking into account any of weight, how much mass can the rocket have 
before no lift of is posible. F = ma  -->   m = F/a   -->  [36N /-9.81 m/s^2]  == -3.67   or 3.67 kg  which would give us 3670g of payload. Now this is abselute max payload,
and would not even get us off the ground much.

So lets come up with a realistic goal of our total mass that we should aim for when building the rocket, and find an acceptable height that meets our parameters.


	We know, 	Force of thrust - Force of Gravity/Mass = Average Acceleration

	We know, 	Velocity = Acceleration * Time (Rocket is thrusting)

	We know,	Disatnce (During burn) = 1/2 Acceleration * time(burning)^2



To find the height the rocket will reach, lets get an appropriate estiamte and weight goal in mind. Each motor weighs about 43g, having 3 of them, we expect 129g of our mass to be
in just the motor, a microcontroller, servo, battery, can all be expected to be around 250g on (hopefully) the high end. Estimating the mass of the body of the print at this
stage is difficult, however 400g of mass dedicated to the body is resonable, with an aditional 50g for extra's/the parachute and cord.

This would give us a ball part estimate of 800g.

Our average acceleration would be 28.97 m/s^2
Our burn final velocity would be about 46.35 m/s
We would achieve 37m during our burn

total height would be about 146 m or 480 feet give or take.

This I think would be an acceptable first launch height, obiously getting our rocket down in weight closer to the 500g mark would give us a much more disarable height of 584m,
which would be much more impressive. Especially for the cost/Motor quantity.
