Design considerations:

The Design is going to be a tri-engine desing... (I'm sure there is a technical name for this) using the D12-3 Rocket motor, since this motor alone can take a resonable 200g
payload not counting for the motor itself. However this does include, the rocket body, electronics...ect.

While, a two motor desing would be possible, I would imagine the design would be more difficult to get even propolsion on both sides causing our rocket to either
launch into the pad or veir way off course.
