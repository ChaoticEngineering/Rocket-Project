We are going to be building a model rocket, to test systems engineering.

Goals..

1) On flight computer will record data, video, and send a retrival beacon for locating 
the rocket

2) Rocket will be 3D printed, and will be desinged to be used with avalible to buy
online rocket motors

3) Rocket will have to saftley detatch and return the computer back to ground at or
just after it begins its decent



There is a future roadmap when we feel we have acomplished our base objective goals.
Since we are new to rockets, starting with the basics is a good base to build from.


Future road map includes:

Being able to control rocket trajectory

Multi-Stage rocket booster design

More Advanced flight data

Real time communication from the ground

Imporved full rocket retrieval
